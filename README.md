Free schematics for a miniaturized, connected blood pressure monitor intended for use in clinics, for ambulatory monitoring, at home, and for telemonitoring.  For a small fee, you can buy additional modules (e.g., firmware for the microcontroller, Algorithm to find the Systolic blood pressure and Diastolic blood pressure, Bluetooth communication application layer, smartphone app on both iOS and Android ) to quickly construct the device.  Add in your own casing and design and you are ready to manufacture to help manage a condition that affects 1.5 billion individuals globally.  Ambulatory devices retail for hundreds to thousands of dollars - profit margins are high.  We will provide consultative support to help you reach the market.
